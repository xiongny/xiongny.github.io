Hi! This is Nuoya Xiong's (熊诺亚) personal page. I am an undergraduate student at IIIS(Yao class), Tsinghua University. My research interest is learning theory, especially theory in reinforcement learning theory and deep learning theory. My research goal is to understand the phenomenon of machine learning and provide new efficient algorithms from the theoretical aspect, serving as a guide for the application of machine learning. 

During my undergraduate years, I was immensely fortunate to receive guidance from several kind and inspiring professors. I am deeply thankful to them for their support and mentorship:
* Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/)
* Prof. [Longbo Huang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/)
* Prof. [Zhuoran Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k7NgVSUAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io/)
* Prof. [Simon S. Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/)

I am also grateful to all my collaborators.
