Hi! This is Nuoya Xiong's (熊诺亚) personal page. I am a first-year PhD student in CMU, Machine Learning Department, advised by Prof. Aarti Singh. Before that, I am an undergraduate student at IIIS(Yao class), Tsinghua University. My recent research interest is learning theory and RLHF/LLM, especially theoretically elegant and implement-friendly algorithms for RLHF/LLM/decision-making. I am also interested in reinforcement learning theory and deep learning theory. My research goal is to understand the phenomenon of machine learning and provide new efficient algorithms from the theoretical aspect, serving as a guide for the application of machine learning. 

I was immensely fortunate to receive guidance from several kind and inspiring professors. I am deeply thankful to them for their support and mentorship:
* Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/)
* Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/)
* Prof. [Longbo Huang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/)
* Prof. [Zhuoran Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k7NgVSUAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io/)
* Prof. [Simon S. Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/)

I am also grateful to all my collaborators.
