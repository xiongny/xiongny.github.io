Hi! This is Nuoya Xiong's personal page. I am an undergraduate student at IIIS (Yao class), Tsinghua University. I am also a visiting student at the University of Washington in Spring 2023. My research interest is learning theory, especially theory in reinforcement learning theory and deep learning theory. My research goal is to understand the phenomenon of machine learning and provide new efficient algorithms from the theoretical aspect, serving as a guide for the application of machine learning.
