Hi! This is Nuoya Xiong's (熊诺亚) personal page. I am a second-year PhD student in CMU, Machine Learning Department, advised by Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/). During the 2025 summer, I spent a perfect time at Meta NYC, working with [Zhuokai Zhao](https://zhuokai-zhao.com/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student at IIIS(Yao class), Tsinghua University. 

In theory, my recent research focuses on the foundations of decision-making, Multi-agent RL and RLHF, with an emphasis on developing theoretically elegant and implementation-friendly algorithms for decision-making. Empirically, I study the post-training and alignment of large language models, focusing on efficient and robust RLHF methods and multi-model collaboration in practical settings.  My research goal is to understand the phenomenon of machine learning and provide new, efficient algorithms from a theoretical aspect, serving as a guide for the application of machine learning. 

I was immensely fortunate to receive guidance from several kind and inspiring professors. I am deeply thankful to them for their support and mentorship:
* Prof. [Aarti Singh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/)
* Prof. [Zhuokai Zhao](https://zhuokai-zhao.com/)
* Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/)
* Prof. [Longbo Huang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/)
* Prof. [Zhuoran Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k7NgVSUAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io/)
* Prof. [Simon S. Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/)

I am also grateful to all my collaborators.
