I think I have performance-level piano skills and enjoy classical music (especially romantic music) and pop music (including anime OST). I am also a member of the Tsinghua University Keyboard Team. 
You can listen to a piece ([Nocturne in B major, Op.62 No.1](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1500981403)) I once played. You can also listen to one of the OSTs I played ([Butterfly](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AG4y1m7y9/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click&vd_source=1e2632a310de26ae86522cb4fe41aa16)).
