I think I have performance-level piano skills and enjoy classical music (especially romantic music) and pop music (including anime OST). I am also a member of the Tsinghua University Keyboard Team. 
You can listen to a piece ([Nocturne in B major, Op.62 No.1](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1500981403)) I once played.
